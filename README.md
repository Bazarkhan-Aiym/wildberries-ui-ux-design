# Wildberries Product Page Redesign (UI/UX Case Study)

This project was developed as part of university coursework, focusing on UI/UX analysis and improvement through a two-stage design process in Figma.

## Project Goal

The primary goal was to improve the usability and logical structure of the Wildberries mobile product page by addressing identified issues in the existing information hierarchy and visual balance.

## Stage 1: Replication and Analysis

I began by accurately replicating the original Wildberries product page layout for a Huawei Honor Type-C charger. This initial step was essential for a thorough analysis of the existing structure and identifying user experience pain points.

## Stage 2: Key Problems and Solutions (Redesign)

The redesign focused on creating a cleaner flow and a more intuitive visual experience.

| Original Problem | Redesign Solution | Result |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| *Broken Reading Order* | *Hierarchy Adjustment:* The product name is now placed immediately after the product photo, followed by the price. | Establishes a logical flow: the user first sees what the product is and then how much it costs. |
| *Price Not Prominent* | *Increased Font Size:* The price is displayed in a larger, bolder font. | The price functions as a key visual element, attracting immediate attention. |
| *Difficult Review Navigation* | *Added Filters:* Introduced filtering buttons: "With Photo," "With Video," and "All Reviews." | Users can quickly find the specific type of feedback they are looking for, improving the decision-making process. |

## Visual Style

The distinct Wildberries brand identity was preserved (purple accent color and light background). The overall look of the page became cleaner, brighter, and more modern, enhancing readability and overall appeal.
