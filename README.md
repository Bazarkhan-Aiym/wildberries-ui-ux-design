# Wildberries Product Page Redesign (UI/UX Case Study)

[span_5](start_span)[span_6](start_span)This project was developed as part of university coursework, focusing on UI/UX analysis and improvement through a two-stage design process in Figma[span_5](end_span)[span_6](end_span).

## 🎯 Goal

[span_7](start_span)[span_8](start_span)The primary goal was to improve the user-friendliness and logical structure of the Wildberries mobile product page while maintaining the brand's recognizable visual style[span_7](end_span)[span_8](end_span).

## 🛠 Stage 1: Replication and Analysis

[span_9](start_span)I began by accurately recreating the original product page layout for a Huawei Honor Type-C laptop charger[span_9](end_span). [span_10](start_span)The goal was to replicate the color scheme, structure, and key elements of the real mobile page[span_10](end_span).

Key recreated elements included:
* [span_11](start_span)Top section with the product image and floating UI icons (back, favorite, share)[span_11](end_span).
* [span_12](start_span)Price section (old price crossed out + new price in bold)[span_12](end_span).
* [span_13](start_span)Product title, seller card, and brand badge[span_13](end_span).
* [span_14](start_span)Fixed bottom action area with "Buy now" and "Add to cart" CTAs[span_14](end_span).

## 🔎 Stage 2: Problem Identification

[span_15](start_span)Analysis of the original design identified several issues that impacted usability[span_15](end_span):
1.  *[span_16](start_span)Incorrect Information Order:* The product name appeared late in the hierarchy, below the price and ratings, making it difficult for the user to immediately identify the product[span_16](end_span).
2.  *[span_17](start_span)Lack of Price Emphasis:* The price font was small and did not function as a key visual element[span_17](end_span).
3.  *[span_18](start_span)Review Navigation:* The review block lacked immediate filtering options[span_18](end_span).

## ✨ Key Improvements Made

[span_19](start_span)The redesigned page focuses on better visual hierarchy and a more intuitive flow[span_19](end_span).

| Improvement | Description | Rationale |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| *Information Hierarchy* | [span_20](start_span)Changed the order so the *product name appears immediately after the photo, followed by the price[span_20](end_span). | [span_21](start_span)This establishes a logical reading flow: the user first sees *what the product is and then how much it costs[span_21](end_span). |
| *Visual Price Emphasis* | [span_22](start_span)Increased the price font size and boldness[span_22](end_span). | [span_23](start_span)The price is now the key visual element, attracting attention[span_23](end_span). |
| *Review Filters* | [span_24](start_span)Added filter buttons to the reviews section: "With Photo," "With Video," and "All Reviews"[span_24](end_span). | [span_25](start_span)Allows users to quickly find the specific type of feedback they want to read[span_25](end_span). |
